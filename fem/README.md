# 🧮 Finite Element Method (FEM)

Welcome to the **Finite Element Method (FEM)** folder of this Computational Science and Engineering repository!  
This section contains step-by-step implementations of classic problems using FEM in both **1D** and **2D**, written in **Python** and **C++**.

---

## 🧠 What’s Covered?

This folder will gradually include a variety of fundamental and advanced problems solved using FEM:

### ✅ Basic Problems
- **1D Poisson Equation**
- **2D Poisson Equation**

### 🧱 Solid Mechanics
- **Linear Elasticity (1D/2D)**
- **Plane Stress and Plane Strain**

### 🌊 Fluid Mechanics
- **Stokes Flow**
- **Navier-Stokes Equations**

### 🔥 Heat Transfer
- **Steady-State Heat Conduction**
- **Transient Heat Equation (with time integration)**

Each problem will contain:
- A Jupyter notebook and/or `.cpp` file
- Comments and explanations for learning purposes
- Plots of results when applicable

## 🛠️ Requirements (Python)

- `numpy`
- `scipy`
- `matplotlib`

Install them via:

```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
```

## 🎯 Goals

This folder is designed for:
- Students learning FEM fundamentals
- Researchers prototyping ideas
- Engineers needing quick testbeds for simulation

No external FEM libraries are used — the point is to build everything from scratch to understand the method deeply.
